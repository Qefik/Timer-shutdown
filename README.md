# Timer-shutdown

Hey! I am a complete amather, I just found it useful for few of my friends. Nothing big, just simple console application. Just run it, write how many minutes you want untill shutdown your computer (for example useful if you want to watch movies and shut down the computer after that or downloading stuff, etc.) and leave the computer.

If there is better solution for this "problem", I did not found it yet. To be honest, for me it is perfect solution, this works fine and I stopped taking care of it. After a year, I am publishing this code and application for everyone, who just wants it and miss this simple task build-in Windows.

I will ty to keep it updated, but if it will work for me at lastest Windows 10 release, it SHOULD work :).
